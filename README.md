Optimization via Cross Entropy Method ðŸŽ¯ 

Cross Entropy Method is a very effective gradient-free #optimization #algorithm. At each iteration, candidate design points are sampled from a probability distribution. The distribution is also fitted every iteration, according to an elite of samples. The distribution family can be chosen by the practitioner: gaussian mixtures, for instance, can help escape local minima. The method can be applied for both continuous and discrete variables! ðŸ¤©

In the plot, the elite is marked as Xs and the remaining candidates as dots. The objective function is a 2D Griewank.
